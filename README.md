## ðŸ’« Quickstart

Generate the project:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/KingMichaelPark/cookiecutter-pypackage
```

The generator will automatically call `hatch env create & git init` at the end.

Then, for the `GitHub Actions pipelines` to work correctly, you should:

* Enable the GitHub repository in `Codecov`.
* Set `CODECOV_TOKEN` in your GitHub repository secrets. You can find in the Codecov settings of the corresponding project.
* Enable `GitHub Pages` using the `GitHub Actions` source.
* Option to publish to Test [`PyPI`](https://test.pypi.org/) for testing.
* Configure the [Trusted Publisher method on PyPI](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/creating-a-project-through-oidc/): it's a modern and secure method to push your package to PyPI.
